README for autosd.

The purpose of the program is to shutdown a laptop when mains power is
off and the battery energy falls to a user determined level.

The program is intended to be run under `cron` or similar.

The parameters the program uses are set in a file $HOME/.config/autosd
which is automatically installed on the first run of the program. As
installed the parameters will suit a lappy with about 1 hour battery
life. You can turn the mains off and run it using the -m | --monitor
option from a console and work out what suits your machine and the
load it carries when running unattended.
